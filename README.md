Machine learning project for COGS181 (Neural Networks) at UCSD.

The aims of this project were to formulate an original problem statement relevant to the machine learning community, select a suitable dataset, train and develop a novel Convolutional Neural Network algorithm, conduct extensive hyper-parameter tuning of various optimization and activation functions, and produce a comprehensive scientific report detailing neural network concepts and experimental findings.
